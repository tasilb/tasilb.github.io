title: The Importance of Writing Skill
---

- writing skill reflects a person's ability to express clear, coherent ideas
- expression through writing receives no help from body language or intonation, so it has to be very precise
- chances are, if you can't write a decent blog post on a thought, then it probably wasn't a quality thought
- the thought may have been half-baked, or just plain dumb
- please don't conflate "inconsistency" or "bad writing" with "writing style" unless you just suck at writing and your writing style is "sucking"
- case in point: I was just an angsty teenager trying to pour my heart out on Tumblr
- being super self-conscious, I frequently deleted or hid the posts longer than a tweet because they were gross
- basically, this was the monologue, "dang not even I would want to read that"
- also, "I sound like a huge tool"
- and, "people will think I'm a dumbass"
- those posts had no solid narrative or direction and were essentially loosely related verbal diarrhea
- writing skill is important because it means that you are capable of putting together higher quality thoughts
- how do you get better at writing?
- tip: realize that you suck
- like angsty teenager David, try writing your best and then reading it and then cringing at it
- reflect on why your writing sucks
- rinse-repeat
- tip: if you speak more than you write, practice speaking precisely
- precise speaking requires a bit of planning in your mind before you speak
- thinking good thoughts is critical when it comes to writing
- the idea is that the clearer your thoughts become, the more they resemble good writing
- at that point, knowing how to write well becomes trivial, as it's more or less a straight transcription of your mind
