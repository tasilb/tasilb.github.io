title: The Importance of Writing Skill
excerpt: You should be concerned if you're not comfortable with writing.
---

Writing skill reflects a person's ability to express clear, coherent ideas. It's a life skill. Expression through writing, unlike speaking, receives no assistance from body language, intonation, or other cues, so it has to be precise to communicate effectively.

If you can't write a decent blog post on a thought, chances are that it probably wasn't a very high quality thought. What that means is that whatever you were thinking about and wanted to write about was likely incomplete, malformed, or just plain dumb. With regards to "decency," please don't conflate "lack of substance" or "bad writing" with "stylistic flair" or "writing style" unless you just suck at writing and your writing style is "sucking."

#### Common signs of low quality thoughts:

- you tried to make it rational but it's not very rational

- it's half-baked

- you distracted yourself

#### Case in point 

I was just an angsty teenager trying to pour his heart out on Tumblr. Being very self-conscious, I usually deleted or hid posts longer than a tweet because after I went back to read them, I realized they were super gross.

The monologue throughout the process went something like this:

{% highlight text %}

me finishing post: "wow dude i just totally poured out my heart onto this post"

"it's so authentic and cool and deep"

me reading post after publishing: "dang not even i can stand reading this"

"i sound like a tool"

"people will think i'm a tool"

"i am a huge tool"

{% endhighlight %}

*Cool? Nope. Deep? Nope. Authentic? Yeah. Gross was authentic.*

Compelling narratives and direction were absent; posts were barely-coherent verbal diarrhea. For hearts worn on the sleeve, what does a comparison to diarrhea say about the person under the shirt? **Don't think that because something "came from the heart," it's automatically good.**

#### Tip for improving: garbage in, garbage out

Writing is just an outlet for your brain. If you are consistently thinking about low quality thoughts, your writing is going to be low quality. Figure out how to get yourself to stop thinking low quality thoughts.

#### Tip for improving: speak precisely, as if you were to write every word that comes out of your mouth

Precise speaking requires a bit of planning before you speak, since it communicates without the help of nonverbal cues. Planning and thinking good thoughts are critical when it comes to writing as well as speaking. The idea here is that the clearer your thoughts become, the more they resemble good writing. At that point, knowing how to write well becomes trivial, as it's more or less a transcription of the mind.

#### tl;dr you should be worried if you're not comfortable with writing
